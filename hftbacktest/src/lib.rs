//! # HftBacktest
//!
//! This Rust framework is designed for developing and running high-frequency trading and
//! market-making strategies. It focuses on accounting for both feed and order latencies, as well as
//! the order queue position for order fill simulation. The framework aims to provide more accurate
//! market replay-based backtesting, based on full order book and trade tick feed data. You can also
//! run the live bot using the same algo code.
//!
//! ## Key Features
//! - Complete tick-by-tick simulation with a variable time interval.
//! - Full order book reconstruction based on L2 feeds(Market-By-Price) and L3 feeds(Market-By-Order).
//! - Backtest accounting for both feed and order latency, using provided models or your own custom model.
//! - Order fill simulation that takes into account the order queue position, using provided models or your own custom model.
//! - Backtesting of multi-asset and multi-exchange models
//! - Deployment of a live trading bot using the same algo code
//!
//!
//! ## Feature flags
//!
//! Currently, `default` enables `backtest`, `live` features.
//!
//! - `backtest`: Enables backtesting features.
//! - `live`: Enables a live trading bot.
//! - `unstable_l3`: Enables Level3 Market-By-Order backtesting.
//! - `unstable_fuse`: Enables the market depth fusion feature, which aggregates different market
//!                    depth streams to provide the finest granularity and the most frequent,
//!                    up-to-date market depth information
